# -Form-Validation
Description:
-Project to build a browser form which collects Email, Country, Zip Code, Password and Password Confirmation fields. It uses live inline validation to inform the user whether a field is properly filled in or not. That means highlighting a field red and providing a helpful error message until it has been filled in properly.
-The form doesn't submit, but it gives an error message if the button is pushed with any active errors or unfilled required fields.
-All validation occurs in the JavaScript file.
-For getting the countries list I have used `countries-list npm package`
