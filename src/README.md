# -Form-Validation
`Description`:
Project to build a browser form which collects Email, Country, Zip Code, Password and Password Confirmation fields. It uses live inline validation to inform the user whether a field is properly filled in or not. That means highlighting a field red and providing a helpful error message until it has been filled in properly.
-The form doesn't submit, but it gives an error message for each line, until the user has typed correctly each input one by one;
-All validation occurs in the JavaScript file;
-For getting all the countries list I used `countries-list npm package` (https://www.npmjs.com/package/country-list-js).
